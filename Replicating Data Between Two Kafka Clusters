Description
Kafka can be deployed in mutliple data centers in an "Active-Active", "Active-Passive", or centralized architecture. In this hands-on lab, we simulate an active-passive architecture in which data from one cluster is replicated to another cluster using a tool called Replicator. Replicator, like MirrorMaker, allows you to preserve topic configuration in the source cluster while replicating the messages from one cluster to another.

Objectives
Successfully complete this lab by achieving the following learning objectives:

Start the Destination Cluster

Start Zookeeper.

bin/zookeeper-server-start etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties
Start Kafka.

bin/kafka-server-start etc/kafka/server.properties
Start the Origin Cluster

Make a copy of the configuration files.

cp etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties /tmp/zookeeper_origin.properties
cp etc/kafka/server.properties /tmp/server_origin.properties
Change the port numbers for the origin cluster.

sed -i -e "s/2181/2171/g" /tmp/zookeeper_origin.properties
sed -i -e "s/9092/9082/g" /tmp/server_origin.properties
sed -i -e "s/2181/2171/g" /tmp/server_origin.properties
sed -i -e "s/#listen/listen/g" /tmp/server_origin.properties
Change the data directory for the origin cluster.

sed -i -e "s/zookeeper/zookeeper_origin/g" /tmp/zookeeper_origin.properties
sed -i -e "s/kafka-logs/kafka-logs-origin/g" /tmp/server_origin.properties
Start Zookeeper.

bin/zookeeper-server-start /tmp/zookeeper_origin.properties
Start Kafka.

bin/kafka-server-start /tmp/server_origin.properties
Create a Topic in the Source Cluster

Create a topic named test-topic with 1 partition and a replication factor of 1.

bin/kafka-topics --create --topic test-topic --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --zookeeper localhost:2171
Run the Replicator Tool

Run Kafka Connect in Standalone Mode and pass in the quickstart-replicator.properties file

bin/connect-standalone etc/kafka/connect-standalone.properties etc/kafka-connect-replicator/quickstart-replicator.properties
Produce and Verify Replication

Verify that the topic was replicated to the destination cluster.

bin/kafka-topics --describe --topic test-topic.replica --zookeeper localhost:2181
Open a Console Producer and write to the topic test-topic in the source cluster.

seq 10000 | bin/kafka-console-producer --topic test-topic --broker-list localhost:9082
Confirm the messages were replicated by opening a console consumer to the destination cluster.

bin/kafka-console-consumer --from-beginning --topic test-topic.replica --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
